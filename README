This is a start at collaborative code for the hackaton project for MSE544 Spring 2023

I am unsure what is the best way to organize this folder for a bunch of people to work on stuff at once, but I have a folder for images (originals as well as modified). There is another folder for scripts written by teammates, so name this accordingly. 

Feel free to make any extra folders as well! Permissions should be fine but let me know if anything needs to be adjusted
